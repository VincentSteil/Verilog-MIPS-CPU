Verilog-MIPS-CPU
================

A MIPS CPU written in behavioural Verilog. It isn't pipelined (yet) Coding it behaviourally is indeed the easy way out. It avoids all the dreadful timing issues I would otherwise be plagued with. This was written solely for us on an FPGA and is thus less likely to be an issue.
